Aimme started using agile based frameworks to create these types of environments about ten years ago. It didn't take her long in her journey to realize that people problems were the biggest issue facing most software development companies. However, it was a only a few years ago that she understood the root of the \"people problem\": company culture. Since then, Aimme has spent her time and energy trying to make every organization a better place to work, play and do business. Aimme works for Cengage Learning as a sometime engineering manager and sometime software developer and is the organizer of Michigan Agile Enthusiasts meetings. A certified culture freak, Aimme also dabbles in lean start up and is a start up wannabee.",
