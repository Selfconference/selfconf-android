With the advent of HTML5 our options for types have exploded, it is now possible to make forms that are more functional, more usable, and a joy to use. That\u2019s just using vanilla html, how much more trouble can we get in if we start playing with CSS and JavaScript? I for one, am tired of trying to use forms with the wrong input types on my smartphone. Won\u2019t you join me in the coalition to end inferior forms, to make the world better for everyone?"

    "description": "The OWASP Foundation maintains a list of the top 10 most critical types of web security vulnerabilities. In the last decade, many of the entries on the list have remained constant, even though they represent issues that are quite well\u00ad understood by the software security community. Worse, when new vulnerabilities are discovered, we still often see developers employ a \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d patching strategy that may block a particular exploit, but does nothing to prevent similar issues from recurring.<br /><br />This talk will explore a much broader and more systemic approach to mitigating some common types of web vulnerabilities, by demonstrating how well\u00ad-designed frameworks (and other tools) can eliminate some entire classes of vulnerabilities from web applications. Together, these examples will illustrate a different mindset to security bugs which, when applied correctly, can greatly improve software quality in general."

If we take a job for a huge raise or a given technology, we can't pass up the fact that we are joining an existing tribe, a group of people that work together to solve a common problem.  Sometimes those tribes inspire you; sometimes they do not.  Why?  People.  When you pick your job, you are actually picking your tribe, a tribe that is going to have an impact on your career.  Be sure to select wisely. <br /><br />In this session, we'll discuss and/or run exercises covering:<br />- Why tribes are so important<br />- What a healthy tribe and an unhealthy tribe look and feel like<br />- How to identify how healthy your tribe is<br />- Why would you want to take your tribe to the next level<br />- How to avoid the \"I'm great, and you're not\" plateau<br />- How to build great tribes"

As smartphones proliferate and everything from thermostats to light bulbs connect to the Internet, this isn\u2019t just a question for academics and huge corporations anymore. <br /><br />At eSpark, we work with teachers and students across the country to provide education using a personalized iPad-based curriculum. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve seen explosive growth in the number of tablets at schools: tablets that require a unique, personalized curriculum of apps; tablets that are not always reliably on wifi; tablets that are often use by kids who haven\u2019t yet learned to read.<br /><br />In this talk, I\u2019ll share what it\u2019s like to go from deploying iPads to a few schools in places like Utica and Romeo near Detroit up to a hundred districts and now beyond, and how we solved the challenges we encountered: building tools atop reverse-engineered iTunes APIs, creating our own mobile device management (MDM) system from scratch, tracking state across multiple systems (including our native iPad app and sometimes-unreliable third-party systems). Along the way, I\u2019ll also show how having a scalable, responsive infrastructure for managing iPads will allow us to innovate and improve K-8 education in future years.<br /><br />"

We'll then see how to assemble Ansible's basic building blocks into reliable and repeatable playbooks for server configuration.<br /><br />We will briefly compare Ansible with other tools that we have used, such as Chef and Capistrano. We will visit other technologies along the way, including Packer (http://packer.io) and Amazon Web Services.<br /><br />Beyond specific tools, the talk will also explore practical principles for succeeding with automation, such as disposable servers, package management, and applying software design principles to infrastructure automation."
